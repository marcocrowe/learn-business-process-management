## Question 1 (33.33 Marks)

Practicing Business Process Management requires the measurement and supervision of process performance. The three main processes are;

- Primary processes,
- Support processes, and
- Management processes.

Provide your understanding for EACH of the THREE processes

### Question 1 Answer

#### 1. Primary Processes

**Understanding:**
Primary processes, also known as core processes, are those that directly create value for customers and are fundamental to the businessâ€™s mission. These processes are integral to the business's ability to produce its primary products or services and are directly linked to the company's strategic goals and objectives. Primary processes typically include the steps taken from the initial input to the final output delivered to the customer.

**Examples:**

- **Manufacturing:** In a car manufacturing company, the assembly line process where raw materials are transformed into a finished vehicle.
- **Sales:** In a retail business, the process of engaging with customers, processing transactions, and delivering products.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Direct impact on customer satisfaction and company revenue.
- Often subject to continuous improvement efforts to enhance efficiency and quality.
- Can vary significantly between different industries and organizations.

#### 2. Support Processes

**Understanding:**
Support processes, also known as secondary processes, provide essential support to the primary processes but do not directly deliver value to customers. Instead, they enable and facilitate the efficient operation of the primary processes. These processes ensure that the resources, systems, and infrastructure required by primary processes are available and functioning properly.

**Examples:**

- **Human Resources (HR):** Recruiting, training, and managing employees.
- **Information Technology (IT):** Maintaining and supporting the technology infrastructure and systems.
- **Procurement:** Acquiring the necessary materials and supplies for production.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Indirect impact on customer satisfaction but crucial for the smooth functioning of primary processes.
- Focus on efficiency, cost management, and compliance.
- Often involve internal stakeholders and cross-functional coordination.

#### 3. Management Processes

**Understanding:**
Management processes involve planning, monitoring, and controlling the business activities to ensure that the organization's goals and objectives are met. These processes are essential for setting strategic direction, making decisions, and overseeing the execution of both primary and support processes. Management processes ensure that the organization is aligned with its strategic objectives and operates efficiently and effectively.

**Examples:**

- **Strategic Planning:** Defining the organization's strategic goals and determining the best course of action to achieve them.
- **Performance Management:** Setting performance targets, monitoring progress, and implementing corrective actions.
- **Compliance and Risk Management:** Ensuring that the organization adheres to legal requirements and manages risks effectively.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Focus on strategic alignment and organizational effectiveness.
- Involve decision-making, leadership, and governance.
- Ensure coordination and integration of various processes within the organization.

#### Summary

In summary, understanding the three main types of processes in BPM is crucial for effectively managing and improving business operations:

- **Primary processes** focus on creating direct value for customers and are central to the business's mission.
- **Support processes** provide essential resources and support to ensure the smooth operation of primary processes.
- **Management processes** involve strategic planning, monitoring, and control to ensure the organization meets its objectives and operates efficiently.

## Question 2 (33.33 Marks)

Draw the BPMN process model diagram for the Insurance Claim Handling Process described below.

Model the Claimant as a separate pool and show all the messages between the claimant and the process.

You do not need to show any intermediate or timer events in your model.

### Insurance claim handling

When a claim is received, we first check if the claimant has a valid insurance policy. If not, the claimant the claim is rejected and the claimant is informed. Otherwise, the severity of the claim is evaluated. Based on the outcome (simple or complex claims), relevant forms are sent to the claimant. Once the forms are returned, we check them for completeness. If the forms are complete, we register the claim in the Claims Management system and the evaluation of the claim may start. Otherwise, the claimant is asked to update the forms. Upon reception of the updated forms, we check them again and continue.

### Question 2 Answer

1. **Create two pools**: one for the Claimant and one for the Insurance Company.
2. **Model the tasks and decision points** in the Insurance Company pool.
3. **Include message flows** between the Claimant and the Insurance Company for communication points.
4. **Show the sequence flows** within the Insurance Company pool to represent the process flow.

Here is a detailed outline of the process based on the provided description:

1. **Claim Submission**: The claimant submits the claim.
2. **Policy Validation**: The insurance company checks if the claimant has a valid policy.
   - If invalid, the claim is rejected and the claimant is informed.
   - If valid, proceed to evaluate the severity of the claim.
3. **Severity Evaluation**: The claim's severity is evaluated (simple or complex).
4. **Form Submission**: Relevant forms are sent to the claimant based on the claim's severity.
5. **Form Return**: The claimant returns the forms.
6. **Form Completeness Check**: The insurance company checks the forms for completeness.
   - If incomplete, the claimant is asked to update the forms.
   - If complete, register the claim and start evaluation.
7. **Claim Registration**: The claim is registered in the Claims Management system.
8. **Claim Evaluation**: The evaluation of the claim starts.

### Question 3 Answer

Sure, let's describe the process depicted in the BPMN diagram for recruiting new applicants for a job. The diagram involves two pools: the Applicant and the Recruitment Process.

#### Process Flow Description

1. **Applicant Pool**:
   - The process begins when the applicant submits an application for a job. This is shown by the **Message Flow** from the Applicant pool to the "Receive and Screen Application" task in the Recruitment Process pool.

2. **Recruitment Process Pool**:
   - **Post Job Ad**: The recruitment process starts with the task of posting a job advertisement. This is the initial task that sets the process in motion.
   - **Receive and Screen Application**: Once applications are submitted, they are received and screened. This involves an initial review to ensure that all necessary information has been provided and that the application meets basic criteria.
   - **Quick Screen**: The screened applications go through a "Quick Screen" process. This likely involves a more detailed review to assess whether the applicant meets the specific qualifications for the job.

3. **Decision Gateway**:
   - After the Quick Screen, there is a **Decision Gateway** to determine if the applicant is "Qualified" or "Not Qualified".
     - **Not Qualified**: If the applicant is not qualified, they are rejected. This is shown by the flow to the "Rejected" end event. Additionally, a rejection message is sent to the applicant as indicated by the dashed message flow line.
     - **Qualified**: If the applicant is qualified, they proceed to the next step, which involves logging the applicant as qualified and then moving on to the "Interview Candidates" task.

4. **Log and Interview**:
   - **Log and Interview Candidates**: For those applicants who are qualified, their details are logged, and they are scheduled for interviews. This is the final step in the depicted process flow, which ensures that all qualified candidates are interviewed.

#### Key Elements

- **Events**:
  - Start Event (circle): Indicates the beginning of the recruitment process with the posting of the job ad.
  - End Events (circle with thick border): There are two end events in this process:
    - "Rejected" for applicants who do not qualify.
    - "Qualified" for those who proceed to interviews.
  
- **Gateways**:
  - The **Decision Gateway** (diamond shape) determines whether an applicant is qualified or not based on the quick screen results.

- **Messages**:
  - **Application**: The initial submission from the applicant to the recruitment process.
  - **Rejection**: A message sent back to the applicant if they are not qualified, informing them of their rejection.

**Summary:**

The process starts with posting a job ad and ends with either rejecting unqualified applicants or scheduling interviews for qualified candidates. It involves an initial screening of applications, a quick screen to further assess qualifications, and a decision gateway to determine the applicant's eligibility. Qualified applicants are logged and proceed to the interview stage, while those not qualified are informed of their rejection. The flow of the process is sequential with clear decision points and communication steps, ensuring efficient and transparent handling of job applications.
